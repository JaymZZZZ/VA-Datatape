# VA-Datatape
Voice Attack Datatape for the DCS F-16C Viper

All you need to do to use it is:

1) download the .vab file and import it into Voice Attack. If you already have a voice attack profile, you can either import this into that profile or you can import it as a separate profile and link them. (VoiceAttack README explains how to do this - https://voiceattack.com/howto.aspx)
2) Create a coordinate file in one of the following locations (example file included in repo)
  * C:\Users\YOUR_USER\Saved Games\DCS.Openbeta\Datatape\datatape.txt
  * C:\Users\YOUR_USER\Saved Games\DCS\Datatape\datatape.txt
  * C:\Program Files (x86)\VoiceAttack\Datatape\datatape.txt
  
3) Use one of the two voice commands:
  * "Load Datatape" - loads all steerpoints in the file
  * "Load Datatape waypoint X" - loads only steerpoint X from the file
  
  
Note: inline.vb file listed here is for informational purposes to show you the inner workings of the script. When you import the .vab file, the inline file is pre-loaded.
